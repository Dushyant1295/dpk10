# dpk10time GitHub Pages Starter

Minimal static site ready for GitHub Pages with a small GSAP micro‑interaction.

## How to deploy

1. Create a public repo named **dpk10time.github.io** on GitHub (use your username instead of `dpk10time` if different).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo and commit to the `main` branch.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Build and deployment** to **Deploy from a branch** with **Branch: `main` / folder: `/`** (root). Save.
4. Visit: `https://dpk10time.github.io` (replace with your username if needed).

### Notes
- `.nojekyll` disables Jekyll processing so folders like `_assets` work.
- Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` to customize.
- Add a `CNAME` file later if you want a custom domain and enable **Enforce HTTPS** in Pages settings.
